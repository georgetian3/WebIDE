# WebIDE


# Build

Run `code-server-install.sh`. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04. May require your VPN to be turned on.

# Run

Run `yarn watch` under in the `code-server` folder. The output may prompt you to visit `127.0.0.1:8080` multiple times, but the web interface can only be successfully accessed once you see the following output:

```[VS Code] [watch-client    ] [xx:xx:xx] Finished compilation with x errors after xxxxx ms```
